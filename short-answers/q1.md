# Question
What's the difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method?

# Answer

<!-- Instance methods are typically bound to the object of a class, and can access + modify both class and instance variables.

Class methods are strictly bound to the class and can only access class variables. -->

So from what I read, a class method needs the name of the class to be invoked when creating it; like a static. While an instance doesn't need the specification of a class since it's already created within that class?

# Teacher Feedback

An instance method can be used by instances of a class meaning an instance is created and the keyword `static` is not needed! Whereas a class method is created through the use of keyword `static` and belongs specifically to the class itself. It can be used by both the class and instances!
