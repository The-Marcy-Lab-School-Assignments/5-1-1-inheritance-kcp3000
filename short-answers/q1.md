# Question
What's the difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method?

# Answer

Instance methods are typically bound to the object of a class, and can access + modify both class and instance variables.

Class methods are strictly bound to the class and can only access class variables.

# Teacher Feedback

An instance method can be used by instances of a class meaning an instance is created and the keyword `static` is not needed! Whereas a class method is created through the use of keyword `static` and belongs specifically to the class itself. It can be used by both the class and instances!
