# Question
What's the difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method?

# Answer

<!-- Instance methods are typically bound to the object of a class, and can access + modify both class and instance variables.

Class methods are strictly bound to the class and can only access class variables. -->

So from what I read, a class method needs the name of the class to be invoked when creating it; like a static. While an instance doesn't need the specification of a class since it's already created within that class?

An instance method is defined within a class and operates on the of class.

A class method is bound (belong) to the class and is not an instance of it.

You got it, one small nitpick is that you can also invoke a static method on instances.

~~You are on the right track! However, please try to go into more detail. What has access to each method, how do they interact with the class or instances, ect. ~~
