# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer

Polymorphism is a concept where multiple types of objects utilize the same property/methods but the use is strictly bind to that specified object. Meaning that the use of that property/method could be used differently to another object.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age){
    this.name = name
    this.age = age
    this.friend = []
  }
  makeFriend(friend) {
    this.friend.push(friend)
    return `Hello, ${friend}. How do you do?`
  }
}

class King extends Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    super(name, age)
    this.maid = []
  }
  addMaids(maid) {
    this.maid.push(maid)
    console.log(`Sir King ${this.name} and his newly recruited maid: ${maid}!`)
  }
  makeAlly(ally) {
    super.makeFriend(ally)//this is an example of polymorphism
    console.log(`I welcome you to my Kingdom, ${ally}`)
  }
}
```
