# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer

Polymorphism is a concept where multiple types of objects utilize the same property/methods but the use is strictly bind to that specified object. Meaning that the use of that property/method could be used differently to another object.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age){
    this.name = name
    this.age = age
    this.friend = []
  }
  makeFriend(friend) {
    this.friend.push(friend)
    return `Hello, ${friend}. How do you do?`
  }
}

class King extends Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    super(name, age)
    this.maid = []
  }
  addMaids(maid) {
    this.maid.push(maid)
    console.log(`Sir King ${this.name} and his newly recruited maid: ${maid}!`)
  }
  makeFriend(ally) {
    super.makeFriend(ally)//this is an example of polymorphism
    console.log(`I welcome you to my Kingdom, ${ally}`)
  }
}
```

So the main error was that what I had before, "makeFriends", disqualify the code from being polymorphic?

You got it! And yes, the point is that you can reuse the method but with different outcomes due to it being used by different classes!
