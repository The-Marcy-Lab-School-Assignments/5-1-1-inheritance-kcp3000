# Question
In a code snippet, demonstrate inheritance by creating two classes where one is the parent class and one is the child class.

In your code example, create an instance of the child class and reference/invoke a property/method of the parent class.

# Answer

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age){
    this.name = name
    this.age = age
    this.friend = []
  }
  makeFriend(friend) {
    this.friend.push(friend)
    return `Hello, ${friend}. How do you do?`
  }
}

class King extends Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    super(name, age)
    this.maid = []
  }
  addMaids(maid) {
    this.maid.push(maid)
    console.log(`Sir King ${this.name} and his newly recruited maid: ${maid}!`)
  }
  makeAlly(ally) {
    super.makeFriend(ally)
    console.log(`I welcome you to my Kingdom, ${ally}`)
  }
}
```
